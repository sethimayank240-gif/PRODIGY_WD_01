✨ Features
Fixed Navigation Bar – The menu stays at the top of the page while scrolling.
Scroll Effect – The navigation bar changes background color when the user scrolls down.
Hover Effect – Menu items change color or style when hovered over.
Responsive Design – Works across different screen sizes.

📂 Project Structure
├── index2.html   # HTML structure of the navigation menu
├── style2.css    # CSS styling for the menu
└── script2.js    # JavaScript interactivity (scroll & hover effects)

🚀 How It Works
HTML (index.html)
Defines the navigation bar and menu items using <nav> and <ul>.
Each menu item links to different sections of the page.
CSS (style.css)
Styles the navigation bar with a fixed position.
Adds background color transitions when scrolling.
Changes font color or background color of items on hover.
JavaScript (script.js)
Listens for the scroll event.
Adds or removes a CSS class when the page is scrolled to apply a new style.
Hover effects are handled with CSS, but JS can be extended for advanced effects.

🖼️ Demo Preview
The navigation bar starts transparent/light.
When scrolling down, it becomes colored or dark for better visibility.
Hovering over a menu item changes its background or text color.

🔧 How to Run
Clone or download the project files.
Open index.html in any browser.
Scroll the page or hover over menu items to see the effects.

📌 Customization
Update colors in style.css to match your theme.
Adjust scroll threshold in script.js to control when the effect triggers.
Add more menu items in index.html as needed.
